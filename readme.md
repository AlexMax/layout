Layout
======

A simple/fast stacking box layout library. It's useful for calculating layouts
for things like 2D user interfaces. It compiles as C99 or C++. It's tested with
gcc (mingw64) and VS2015, but should probably build with Clang/LLVM with a few
changes.

It comes with a small set of tests as a build target, along with a primitive
benchmark and example usage of the library as a Lua .dll module.

Building is handled by [GENie](https://github.com/bkaradzic/GENie), but no
executable binaries are included in this source repository. You will need to
download (or build yourself) a GENie executable and place it in your path or at
the root of this repository tree. If you want to build on a platform other than
Windows, you'll likely need to modify genie.lua for compatibility.

However, if you want to use Layout in your own project, you can probably copy
layout.h and layout.c into your project's source tree and use your own build
system. You don't necessarily have to build *Layout* as a shared library and
link against it. There are no external dependencies.

*Layout* is based on the nice library
[oui](https://bitbucket.org/duangle/oui-blendish) by duangle. Unlike *oui*,
*Layout* does not handle anything related to user input, focus, or UI state.

You will first need to get (or make) a GENie binary and place it in your path
or at the root of this repository.
